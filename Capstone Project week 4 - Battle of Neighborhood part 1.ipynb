    "   Since the beginning of 2020, Jakarta and many other cities around the world have been under attack by an invisible army called ‘Novel Corona Virus’, also known as ‘Covid-19’. Every effort has been focusing on solving or minimizing problems, including Data Scientists. Data Scientists assessed the situations in places around the world, such as availability, amount, and geographical distribution (i.e. locations) of health infrastructures, such as virus testing centers and authorized hospitals to treat affected patients. In this article, we would like to present a simple analysis for determining strategic locations for the distribution of masks and medical devices for COVID-19 treatment, based on confirmed cases on May 28, 2020, and the red zone areas for “new normal” condition analysis."
